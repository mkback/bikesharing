# Citi Bike Sharing 

## Overview 
Bike and scooter sharing systems have become more and more popular in the recent years, especially in large cities. In this project we took a look at data from a bike share company in New York City. Once the data was cleaned using Pandas, we could use Tableau to create visuals for the findings.

## Results
The dots on the below map are larger and darker in color based on the number of rides starting from that pick-up point. We can see it is most popular in downtown Manhattan.

The below bar chart shows the peak hours for use are 8am, 5pm and 6pm. These hours are commute hours, so people may be using the bikes to get to and from work.

The below chart gives us a lot information on the users. Just like the above map, the darker the color represents a larger number of users. We can see that there are way more subscriber users as opposed to one-time customers. The users are also predominantly make and using the bikes on weekdays.
