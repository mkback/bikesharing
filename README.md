## Summary 

##### The analysis shows that the Citi bikes are very popular in NYC. It is especially popular for men commuting in downtown Manhattan. When expanding to Des Moines, the downtown area should be the key area. With this dataset we can also look at how much each bikes were used and if there are any areas or bikes that are not being used. We can do this by doing a map and the size being the ride count by bike ID or a bar graph with the bike ID and count of rides.
